Plans and schemes, thoughts and dreams,
Who cares what they mean?
When they work they're amazing things,
But when they don't I hear you scream.

Chorus:
Spiders and flies live and die,
Six legs to stand on and two wings to fly.
I can't remember and I can't decide
What was the season and the color of your eyes, eyes

A thousand kings, favorite queens,
Buried with them precious rings.
When they lived they loved complete,
But in their tombs I hear them scream.

Chorus

Songs and spells, magic glass,
Who cares what they cast?
I dreamed I'd always love you complete.
I never thought I'd hear you scream.

2X:
Spiders and flies live and die,
Eight legs to stand on and two wings to fly.
It makes you wonder, "Why can't I?"
What was the reason for the color of your eyes, eyes
