Here I am
There's no one around
Scary voices
Try to bring me down
All I hear
Are these trippy sounds
That are crawling inside my head

Little black spiders
Those little black spiders
Little black spiders
Those little black spiders
Little black spiders
Those little black spiders
Little black spiders
Those little black spiders

Listen to the callings of the mongoloids
Riding thoughts and inner sounds
Ditch a ride on the vertical train
To the deep underground
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling

Little black spiders
Those little black spiders
Little black spiders
Those little black spiders
Little black spiders
Those little black spiders
Little black spiders
Those little black spiders
