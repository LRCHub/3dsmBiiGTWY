I heard you're the type to do
All the things I won't for free
When the people talk 'bout you
Are you all they hoped you'd be?

'Cause I keep my lights down low
You won't know when my next move
Cooking up like mama food
Shook you up like spiders do

'Cause I keep my lights down low
You won't know when my next move
Cooking up like mama food
Shook you up like spiders do

I heard you're the type to do
All the things I won't for free
When the people talk 'bout you
Are you all they hoped you'd be?

I just think it's funny how
Bitches in their feelings now
'Cause I'm getting money and it's
Showing like their tummies out
I been laughing harder now
They just scream my name out loud
Junglepussy poppin' off like
Them bitches running their mouths

(Hello you) jaded fool
Loving me, it ain't a crime
Touching me, I swear it's like
Reaching for the highest high
Coming down, crashing like
Meteor shower lights
I'll give you some time of day
But you cannot spend the night
