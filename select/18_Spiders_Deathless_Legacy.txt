Eight legs for eight eyes
Watching you searching the light
Hidden in dust without any sound
Waiting the whisper to attack you behind

Poison that runs in my veins
Venom burns under my skin
It dazed false dreams in my head
The sting wasted my neck
It seems like it is making me mad

Silent scream in the night
The heart stops for a while
Your eyes are tourning white
Is not worth the sight

The soldier of Death
Scamps now at your back
Waiting for spider's revenge
You think it's so useless
He wants make you see
All the paths of your insanity

A web in your mind
You can't escape
It runs in the cellar
To bite you again
They rise from the stairs
And that is the end
You feel the pain walking
On your stucked head
