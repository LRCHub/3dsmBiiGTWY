There's a man in the street
Who tells me that he loves me
God is everywhere
He says he lives above me
I know more about this man
Than I know about you
Further than we go
In what we go through
We are small
We are small people
There's a day in a month
When I know why we're here
And no one drags us down
When you flip my gear
My mother doesn't love you
Even though she tries
I told her so many things
I forget the lies
We are small
We are small people
You will take the whole of me
The whole of me
