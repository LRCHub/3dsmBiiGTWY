The icicles chime
Fingerings lost in the motions of our hands
Sit just as you are
Lost in the crime
Carry the choir
Age and peel
After the quiet bleeds peel and age
Familiar peace in the pain
Pulling you wrong in soft belief and midnight finish
A violent quiet freeze
The carnival fighters are sharing a bed tonight
Bruised in the hay
The circle around the brawl divides in frozen rain
On spiders house
After the quiet bleeds peel and age
Familiar peace in the pain
Raindrops tremble and wait to freeze
On spiders house
